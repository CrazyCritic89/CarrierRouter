# CarrierRouter
An Elite Dangerous tool that plots a carrier route similar to [Spansh's Fleet Carrier Router](https://spansh.co.uk/fleet-carrier).

## Why does this exist?

A friend of mine requested I try making this because of there being no alternative when the site is down. I'm mostly doing this out of fun though.

## Is it good?

No.




Currently, this only requires installing the module `requests`.
